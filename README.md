**This repository holds all the issues for overall mozilla.ch topics. This includes goals and supporting issues.**

Every goal is tagged with the "Objectives" label, issues supporting these goals can use [this template](https://github.com/mozillach/participation). These "Objective" issues are not necesseraly ready to work on, so we try to create those sub issues. These can be "meta" issues (for example: create event XY) with supporting issues file against that one (make sure to reference the meta issue), or direct issues that do not require sub issues. Please open your own issues you want to work on or for ideas you came up with and need somebody to support you in their implementation!

**This boils down to the following structure:**

Objective -> Meta -> Subissues to work on

or

Objective -> Issue to work on



There is a [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/mozillach/participation) to visualize all open issues.
